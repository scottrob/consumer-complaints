#Ultimate Pigs
Ultimate pigs is a game where you roll a die and add up the faces to get the highest possible score!
 But, be careful, because if you roll a 1 you loose all the points you gained for that round.
  After 7 rounds you total the round scores.

This program has computer players play the game and then does mathy-magic to graph about which player played best


I have no idea how to describe installation and -run commands with this program...
